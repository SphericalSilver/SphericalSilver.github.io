									<h2>Interdum sed dapibus</h2>-->
									
									<p>I'm Suyash! Code lover, committed learner, diet Coke addict, and aspiring Data Analyst! </p>
									
									<p>My language skills include SQL, Python, and R, and I'm familiar with programs like Tableau, Microsoft Excel, and Origin. I also have a handle on some front-end languages like HTML and CSS, and I'm currently teaching myself Javascript on the side as a hobby!</p>
									
									<p>I believe the world runs smoother when people listen to the stories data has to tell. Things fall into place for people more seamlessly when they're able to organize and make sense of the universe around them with great efficiency. Life is easier when decisions are made that are informed by these realities. Having been led towards this path by my persistently inquisitive and logical predisposition, I hope to be able channel my curiosity and fondness for intelligent analysis into an avenue that might be best served them.</p>

									<h2>Why Data?</h2>
									<p>About a couple of years into my Chemistry Undergrad degree, I realized something that I always knew in the back of my head, but never quite confronted head-on - Chemistry was definitely not my calling in life! I wasn't particularly bad at it or anything. It just never aroused much interest in me. A couple of years had to go by of me trying to fruitlessly convince myself that I liked Chemistry, before I finally threw in the towel and decided that I couldn't go on lying to myself, and that my true ambitions lied elsewhere. At the time, however, it wasn't yet clear to me just where that was.</p>
									<p>What was painfully and blindingly clear to me was how miserable that feeling of untapped potential left me. I knew I could never maximize my potential in something I found as exasperatingly dull as my major. But I was already a few years into my degree, and at that point I figured it was best to accept that for better or worse, this was the path I had chosen, and so I resolved to trudge through to the end, just drearily counting the semesters until graduation.</p>
									
									<p>I tried to ensure variety in the courses I took, to get as much exposure to different fields of Chemistry as I could, hoping that eventually something would catch my interest. And then as fate would have it, one semester I dabbled in a Computational Chemistry module, and for the first time in my Undergraduate life, I was completely blown away. While my initial goal was to chance across something that might vaguely pique my interests, I could never have guessed that I was about to be utterly swept off my feet. The feeling of excitement my Python projects and lessons inspired in me was like nothing else before. Earlier in life, I had used languages like Java, LUA and Python, back when I was in Junior College (although that was mainly for gaming-related purposes!). I even had some familiarity with HTML/CSS from when I was tinkering around with my attempt at a personal website way back in Secondary School, but all these memories were much too distant to readily occur to me as possible options I could consider pursuing. It wasn't until Python was finally staring me in the face again after all those years that an old spark I hadn't felt in a long time finally started to rekindle. It was refreshing and thrilling beyond words to once again feel that sense of purposeful excitement - something that was almost alien to me by that point! The coding assignments in that module were by far my favorite projects in University, and by the time the module was over, I had written a game of Connect-4 in Python with a team!</p>
									
									<p>One tiny doubt gnawed at me. I wasn't a Computer Science major! But I knew I wasn't going to let that feeling of reinvigorated passion go to waste. I looked at what I DID have. I had a reignited love for coding, and an Undergraduate background (as boring as it was) that emphasized critical thinking, and evidence-based, data-driven scientific writing skills. I also had a logical predisposition very much inclined towards reasoned-problem solving - I was always a person who put a lot of stock in data and hard numbers. It didn't take a lot of introspection before I figured out the kinds of fields I should research into that would suit my aptitudes, and when I finally stumbled upon the world of Data Science, I was stunned by how I had landed upon the perfect fit. There wasn't any need to second-guess myself. This was it. And so I took the plunge, and never looked back since.</p>
									
									<p>Since the time Python returned into my life, I've been charging full steam ahead into the realm of Data. I've been fiercely committed to constantly teaching myself new skills, improving my existing ones, and being a better Data Analyst than I was yesterday. At this juncture, I've come to possess a solid basis in programs like R, Tableau, SQL, and particularly Python. I've taken the arduous steps necessary to fill any knowledge gaps I might have had, and as of this moment I've even accrued a fairly sizeable portfolio of projects in Data Science.</p>
									<p>And I'm definitely no where close to finished!</p>
