											<h3>Employee Exit Survey Analysis</h3>
											<p>Generally, it's critical for a company to understand the factors that make employees leave. In the event that an employee leaves citing grievances with the company, the management should be alert as to whether this trend repeats among other employees, and if so, they should understand what kind of employee might be most likely to feel that way, and how they could go about addressing any underlying issues. This project sees us analyzing what kind of employees might be most likely to leave over their frustrations.</p>

											<h3>Investigating Earnings, Employment Rates, and Student Demographics by University Major</h3>
											<p>Employment Rates and median salaries associated with various University majors in US Universities were analyzed to understand the relationship between those factors and each major.

											<h3>Coursera Project Compilation</h3>
											<p>Over the course of the Applied Data Science Specialization program, several projects were done, some of which are featured here in the linked repository. House Price comparisons were done and a t-test was used to determine if the change in house prices before and after a recession was significant. Temperature records over the years 2005-2015 were visualized, and a few other custom visualizations were made in a handful of smaller projects.</p>
